        <p>Hi <?= emailData.name ?>,</p>
        <p>
            Signups for The Bone Dry Comedy Hour are only accepted the Sunday
            and Monday before the open mic. If you signed up on Tuesday you may
            still be able to get on stage. Sometimes people can't (or don't)
            make it to the show for their spot. When this happens we call
            someone from the standby list. You can sign up for a standby spot at
            7pm. The show begins at 8pm in Last Best Comedy at 321 E Main St.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you signed up between Wednesday and Saturday please resubmit on
            Sunday or Monday.

        <p>Thanks, Bone Dry Comedy</p>
