# Open Mic Signup

This project is a way to automate the management of an open mic.
There are two major pieces of this that must be created in Google Workspaces
in order for this to work.

1. Create a Google Form to collect signups connected to a Google Sheet doc.
2. In the Google Sheet document create an additional sheet titled 'Current List'

## Open Mic Rules

The open mic we ran implemented the following structure.

- The show is on Tuesday night.
- Signups are only open Sundays and Mondays.
- There are only 24 spots available.
- Signups beyond the 24th are "bumped"
  - people who are "bumped" get guaranteed spots _if_ they sign up the following week
- Inclusion in the list of 24 is randomized and _not_ in order of signup.
- People get a varying amount of time for their set decided by whoever runs the show.
- The list will be distributed by email.
