# Open Mic Signup

This project is a way to automate the management of an open mic.
There are two major pieces of this that must be created in Google Workspaces
in order for this to work.

1. Create a Google Form to collect signups connected to a Google Sheet doc.
2. In the Google Sheet document create an additional sheet titled 'Current List'

## Open Mic Rules

The open mic we ran implemented the following structure.

- The show is on Tuesdays.
- Signups are only open Sundays and Mondays
